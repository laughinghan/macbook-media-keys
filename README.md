- With [KeyboardRemap4MacBook][],
    - (which, btw, by default adds a menu bar icon, which is I think
      is annoying and disabled)
    - under "Change F1..F19 Key & Functional Key (Brightness Control,
      Music Control, Volume Control)",
        - under "Functional Keys to F1..F12",
            - check "Music Controls to F7,F8,F9".
- In System Preferences,
    - under Keyboard,
        - under Keyboard Shortcuts > Expose & Spaces > Spaces,
            - make sure "Activate Spaces" with F8 is NOT checked.
- With [BetterTouchTool][],
    - under Gestures > Keyboard,
        - click "Add new keyboard shortcut" in the lower right corner,
        - click "Click to record shortcut" under "Keyboard Shortcut"
          below and to the left of that,
        - choose the "Predefined Action",
          "Open Application / File / Script..." (in the middle of the
          very, very long menu, so scroll way down)

Note: if three-finger swiping in Chrome, for example, mysteriously stops
working, "Restart BTT now" from the BetterTouchTool menu often fixes it.

The idea to use a combination of KeyboardRemap4MacBook and
BetterTouchTool [came from connermcd][connermcd].
